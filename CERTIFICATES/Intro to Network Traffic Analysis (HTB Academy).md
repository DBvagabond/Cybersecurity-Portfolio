# Intro to Network Traffic Analysis
This repository contains some of the projects and exercises that I completed during the Intro to Network Traffic Analysis course from HTB Academy. The course taught me how to capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic using tools such as Wireshark and Tcpdump. I learned how to:
- Identify different types of network protocols and their characteristics
- Filter and extract relevant information from network packets
- Recognize common network attacks and anomalies
- Perform basic network forensics and incident response
- Create custom scripts and tools to automate network analysis tasks
Comnpleting this course helped me improve my network analysis skills and knowledge using various tools and techniques. It also challenged me to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios and problems.
