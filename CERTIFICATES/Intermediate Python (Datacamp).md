# What I learned from the intermediate Pyyhon Datacamp Course

I have completed the intermediate Python course on DataCamp, where I learned how to create stunning plots with Matplotlib, manipulate data with pandas, use logic and control flow, and apply hacker statistics. I have also worked on several projects using Python and its libraries, which I will showcase below.

## My Skills

- **Python**: I have a solid understanding of the Python syntax, data structures, functions, and modules. I can write clean and efficient code using Python's best practices and style guidelines.
- **Matplotlib**: I can create various types of plots and customize them with labels, legends, titles, axes, colors, and annotations. I can also use subplots, histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and error bars to visualize data and communicate insights.
- **pandas**: I can use pandas to import, explore, clean, and manipulate data in different formats, such as CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL. I can also use pandas to perform operations such as filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregating, merging, and reshaping data. I can also use pandas to apply functions, methods, and lambda expressions to data.
- **Logic and Control Flow**: I can use conditional statements, loops, and comprehensions to control the flow of my code and create complex logic. I can also use try-except blocks to handle errors and exceptions gracefully.
- **Hacker Statistics**: I can use hacker statistics to simulate data and perform statistical inference. I can also use random numbers, distributions, and resampling techniques to test hypotheses and estimate parameters.
