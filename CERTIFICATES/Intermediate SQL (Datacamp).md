# What I learned from the intermediate SQL DataCamp course

I have completed the intermediate SQL DataCamp course and learned a lot of new skills and techniques to query and analyze data using SQL. Here are some of the main topics that I learned from the course:

## Filtering and comparing data

I learned how to use various operators and keywords to filter and compare data in SQL. For example, I learned how to use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on a condition, the `BETWEEN` operator to filter values within a range, the `IN` operator to filter values from a list, the `LIKE` operator to filter values based on a pattern, and the `NULL` keyword to filter missing values. I also learned how to use the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators to combine multiple conditions, and the `CASE` statement to create conditional logic.

## Using aggregate functions to summarize data

I learned how to use aggregate functions to calculate summary statistics from a group of values. For example, I learned how to use the `COUNT` function to count the number of rows or non-null values, the `SUM` function to add up all the values, the `AVG` function to calculate the average value, the `MIN` and `MAX` functions to find the minimum and maximum values, and the `ROUND` function to round the values to a specified number of decimal places. I also learned how to use the `DISTINCT` keyword to remove duplicate values before applying an aggregate function.

## Sorting and grouping data

I learned how to use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results of a query by one or more columns, and how to use the `ASC` and `DESC` keywords to specify the sort order. I also learned how to use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the rows by one or more columns, and how to use the `HAVING` clause to filter the groups based on an aggregate condition.

## Presenting data cleanly

I learned how to use various tools and techniques to present data cleanly and clearly in SQL. For example, I learned how to use the `AS` keyword to create aliases for columns and tables, the `CONCAT` function to concatenate strings, the `||` operator to concatenate strings with a separator, the `COALESCE` function to replace null values with a default value, and the `CAST` function to convert data types.

## Using math functions

I learned how to use math functions to perform mathematical operations and calculations in SQL. For example, I learned how to use the `ABS` function to get the absolute value, the `MOD` function to get the remainder of a division, the `SQRT` function to get the square root, the `POWER` function to raise a number to a power, the `LOG` function to get the natural logarithm, and the `EXP` function to get the exponential value.

## Processing data with variables and loops

I learned how to use variables and loops to store and manipulate data in SQL. For example, I learned how to use the `DECLARE` statement to declare a variable, the `SET` statement to assign a value to a variable, the `SELECT` statement to assign a value from a query to a variable, the `IF` statement to create conditional logic, the `WHILE` statement to create a loop, and the `BREAK` statement to exit a loop.
