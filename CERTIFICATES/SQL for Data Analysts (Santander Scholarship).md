# SQL for Data Analysis

This repository contains my learning journey and the skills I've acquired during my Data Analyst certification.

## Skills Acquired

1. **Basic SQL Queries**: I learned how to use basic SQL commands to select data from tables. This includes using the `SELECT` statement and specifying columns to display.

2. **Advanced SQL Queries**: I learned how to manipulate data and use functions in SQL queries. This includes using the `AS` keyword to rename columns, using the `UPPER` function to convert text to uppercase, and using the `SUBSTR` function to extract substrings from a field.

3. **Filtering and Sorting**: I learned how to filter records using the `WHERE` clause and sort records using the `ORDER BY` clause. I also learned how to use logical operators like `AND` and `OR` to combine conditions.

4. **Date and String Functions**: I learned how to work with date and string values. This includes extracting parts of a date using the `SUBSTR` function, and filtering records based on date ranges.

5. **Aggregate Functions**: I learned how to use aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to perform calculations on data.

6. **Joining Tables**: I learned how to join tables to combine data from multiple tables into a single result set.

7. **Subqueries**: I learned how to use subqueries to create complex queries and manipulate data.

I'm excited to apply these skills in real-world data analysis projects!
