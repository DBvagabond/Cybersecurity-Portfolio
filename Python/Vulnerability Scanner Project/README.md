# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

This project is a custom-built Vulnerability Scanner designed to identify security weaknesses in networks, web applications, and system configurations. It was created as a personal project to develop and enhance my cybersecurity skills, providing hands-on experience with tools and techniques used by security professionals.

Features:
- **Network Scanning**: Identifies live hosts on a network.
- **Port Scanning**: Detects open ports on target systems.
- **Web Vulnerability Scanning**: Checks for common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection.
- **System Configuration Checks**: Analyzes system settings for weak passwords and outdated software.
- **Report Generation**: Compiles scan results into a structured report.
- **Automated File Saving**: Scans are saved automatically with timestamps in the filenames, ensuring organized storage.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

The scanner can be used to identify security vulnerabilities in a controlled and responsible environment. You can customize the IP ranges, URLs, and system checks in the respective modules before running the main.py script.

## Legal Disclaimer

The primary goal of this project is to enhance my understanding of cybersecurity practices and techniques. Unauthorized use of this tool against systems that you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical. Misuse of this tool can lead to serious legal consequences, including criminal charges.

Always obtain proper authorization before scanning or testing any network or system.
