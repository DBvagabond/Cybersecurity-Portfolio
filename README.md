# My abilities
## Conducting security audits
During my Google Cybersecurity course, I was trained to conduct security audit in an organization. Such audit may vary in specific companies, but standard way of doing it consists of:
- **Reviewing audit scope and goals**
  - I carefully analyze the organization's objectives, systems, and assets to define the scope and goals of the audit. This initial step allows me to establish a clear understanding of the specific areas that need to be assessed. 
- **creating company risk assesment**
  - I conduct a comprehensive analysis of the organization's risk landscape, identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their associated impact. This assessment enables me to prioritize areas for further examination and focus on mitigating the most critical risks.  
- **Analyzing audit scope, goals, and risk assessment**
  - I meticulously examine the established audit scope, goals, and risk assessment findings to ensure alignment and accuracy. This step enables me to fine-tune the audit process and tailor it to the unique needs and challenges of the organization.
- **Conducting controls assessment**
  - I evaluate the organization's existing security controls, including technical, administrative, and physical measures. This assessment allows me to identify any gaps or weaknesses in the security infrastructure and recommend appropriate improvements. [Example Controls assessment](assets/Controls-assessment.pdf)
- **Conducting Compliance cheklist**
  - I meticulously review the organization's adherence to relevant industry standards, legal regulations, and best practices. This assessment ensures that the organization is meeting the required compliance criteria and helps identify any compliance gaps that need to be addressed. [Example Compliance checklist](assets/Compliance-checklist.pdf)
- **Analyzing audit results**
  - I analyze the findings from the controls assessment, risk assessment, and compliance checklist to generate a comprehensive view of the organization's cybersecurity posture. This analysis allows me to identify potential vulnerabilities, threats, and areas of improvement.
- **Communicating results and recommendations**
  - I prepare detailed reports summarizing the audit findings, including identified risks, vulnerabilities, and recommended remediation measures. I ensure clear and concise communication of these results to stakeholders, including executive management, IT teams, and relevant personnel.

## Conducting Network Traffic Analysis
During my Google Cybersecurity course, I obtained knowledge necessary to conduct Network Traffic Analysis followed by Incydent Report
[Example Incydent Report](assets/network-traffic-analysis.pdf)

I possess expertise in analyzing network and webpage data logs using tools like Wireshark and tcpdump. This proficiency allows me to identify potential attacks, such as DDoS, MitM, SQL injection, and XSS vulnerabilities, through the examination of traffic patterns and HTTP requests and responses.

I have acquired knowledge and expertise in implementing robust measures to harden networks and OS. Through my experience and comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity best practices, I have honed the skills required to fortify digital infrastructures and enhance their resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

knowledge of Linux and its tools

## Linux
I have acquired proficiency in utilizing various Linux commands that are essential for effectively managing directories and files, as well as setting permissions for users on these resources. Through my experience, I have learned to efficiently navigate and manipulate the Linux file system. I am adept at creating, deleting, and renaming directories, as well as moving and copying files with precision.
An integral aspect of my skill set involves setting precise permissions on directories and files to ensure data security and privacy. I employ the Linux `chmod` and `chown` commands to assign appropriate read, write, and execute permissions to users, groups, and others, thus granting controlled access as required.
By leveraging these Linux commands, I enable robust access control mechanisms, safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion. My proficiency in Linux-based directory and file management serves as a valuable asset in bolstering the security posture of digital assets within an organization's infrastructure. During my Google Cybersecurity Certification I had a chance to practice this skillset as shown in this example exercise: [Example Linux exercise](assets/premissions_Linux.pdf)

## SQL
I have acquired essential skills in utilizing SQL to bolster security measures and effectively analyze data in the cybersecurity field. With expertise in SQL filtering and joins, I proficiently extract valuable insights from databases, aiding in the identification and mitigation of potential security threats.
Through my experience, I have harnessed the power of SQL filtering to query and retrieve specific data sets that are pertinent to cybersecurity investigations. By crafting precise queries, I efficiently filter through vast datasets, enabling me to focus on critical information crucial for incident response and threat analysis.
Moreover, my knowledge of SQL joins allows me to combine data from multiple tables, thereby enhancing the correlation and contextual understanding of cybersecurity events. The ability to perform inner, outer, and self-joins enables me to consolidate and leverage disparate data sources, facilitating a comprehensive view of potential security incidents and attack patterns.
